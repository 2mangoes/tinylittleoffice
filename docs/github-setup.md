# The repository on GitHub

The source is public at **https://github.com/aboard-io/tinylittleoffice**, in the Aboard organization, under
the MIT License. It was renamed, moved to the organization and opened on 2026-10-11; GitHub redirects the old
address. This page is what the files in the repository cannot do: the settings set by hand, each a box to check,
with the strings exact, to paste. The files assume every one of them.

## Who may push

- **Paul** (an owner of the organization) is the repository's admin, and the only one who may tag a release.
- **Maintainers** are an organization team with the **Maintain** role on the repository; while there is no
  second maintainer the team is Paul alone.
- **Everyone else** works in a fork and opens a pull request; CI runs on it, and a maintainer merges it.
- [ ] Settings → Collaborators and teams: the maintainers' team with **Maintain**; nobody with **Admin** but
      the organization's owners.
- [ ] The organization's Settings → Actions: allow GitHub's own actions and those of verified creators
      (`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, `actions/attest-build-provenance`), each pinned in the workflows
      by its full commit hash; require approval for workflows from first-time contributors' forks.

## The branch rule (Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New branch ruleset)

- [ ] Ruleset name: `main`; enforcement: **Active**; target: the default branch.
- [ ] **Restrict deletions**; **Block force pushes**.
- [ ] **Require a pull request before merging**: 0 approvals while Paul works alone (1 once there is a second
      maintainer); dismiss stale approvals; require conversation resolution.
- [ ] **Require status checks to pass**: the check `check` (the CI workflow's one job, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
      every check a deploy runs, then the lints, the advisories and the build made twice); check **Require
      branches to be up to date before merging**.
- [ ] **Require signed commits**: recommended, not required, until every contributor signs; revisit at launch.
- [ ] Bypass list: none. A deploy is a tag (Releases, below), not a commit made from anyone's machine.

## The About box (the repository's front page, the gear beside About)

- [ ] Description: `A free office suite where your document is the link. No account; nothing kept unless you choose; the code open.`
- [ ] Website: `https://tinylittleoffice.com`
- [ ] Topics: `office-suite` `privacy` `local-first` `no-backend` `pwa` `web-components` `lit` `cloudflare-workers`
      `typescript` `url-as-document` `markdown`
- [ ] Include in the home page: **Releases** on, **Packages** off, **Deployments** on (each tag's deploy to the
      environment `production`).

## General (Settings → General)

- [ ] Social preview: the Office mark's share card, `public/og.png` (drawn by `npm run icons`).
- [ ] Features: **Issues** on; **Discussions** off; **Wiki** off (the docs are in `docs/`); **Projects** off.
- [ ] Pull requests: allow **squash merging** and **merge commits**, not rebase merging; check **Always suggest
      updating pull request branches** and **Automatically delete head branches**.

## Issues (Issues → Labels)

There are no issue templates and no pull request template (Paul, 2026-10-12: only the license and the README,
both brief); an issue is a blank one.

- [ ] `bug` (`#d73a4a`, "Something is wrong") and `feature` (`#a2eeef`, "Something it could do"), applied by hand.
- [ ] `dependencies` (`#0366d6`): Dependabot applies it to its pull requests.
- [ ] One per app in the registry (`src/kit/apps.ts`), color `#c5def5`: `app: <id>` (`app: write`, `app: sheet`…).
- [ ] `kit` (`#fbca04`, "The shell, the bar, the editor and the rest of src/kit"), `kernel` (`#fbca04`,
      "src/doc: the model, TLO, the operations"), `tinier` (`#bfd4f2`, "The short-link service"),
      `docs` (`#0075ca`), `security` (`#b60205`, "Security-relevant, after disclosure").
- [ ] Delete the defaults that do not fit (`enhancement`, `question`, `wontfix`, `invalid`; `duplicate`,
      `good first issue` and `help wanted` may stay).

## Security (Settings → Code security)

- [ ] **Private vulnerability reporting** on: it is the only way the README gives to report a hole (no
      SECURITY.md, no email address).
- [ ] **Dependency graph** and **Dependabot alerts** on; **Dependabot security updates** on. Version updates are
      `.github/dependabot.yml`: npm, weekly, the site's dependencies in one pull request and the tools' in
      another. Such a pull request also needs `npm run docs:deps` run on its branch (docs/dependencies.md names
      each exact version), or CI fails it.
- [ ] **Secret scanning** and **push protection** on.
- [ ] Code scanning: not yet (CI runs `npm audit` with no ignores).

## Releases and deploys

A release is a tag `v*`, and the tag is the deploy: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs `scripts/deploy.mjs` on
the runner (every check, the shortener's migrations, the two Workers, the command line on npm with provenance),
checks the live site against the build, then builds the tag again, builds it twice more to show the bytes are the
same, attests `dist/` and an archive of it, and publishes the archive with notes naming the commit and the CSP's
script hashes (docs/transparency.md §1 item 3). A deploy that failed part way is run again from the Actions tab
(Deploy → Run workflow, "Use workflow from" the tag, and the tag again as the input); the release is made once.

- [ ] Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → **Repository secrets**: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (an account-owned
      token: Workers Scripts Edit, D1 Edit and Account Settings Read on the account; Workers Routes Edit and Zone
      Read on tinylittleoffice.com), `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `NPM_TOKEN` (a granular token that may publish the
      command line's package). Only the deploy step of the Deploy workflow names them; CI has none.
- [ ] Settings → Environments → New environment `production`: no required reviewers (the tag is the approval), no
      wait timer; **Deployment branches and tags**: selected, the tag rule `v*`, so nothing but a tag deploys.
- [ ] Stronger, when convenient: move the three secrets from the repository to the environment `production`
      (the workflow reads them the same way), so only a run from a tag `v*` can read them at all, not any workflow
      someone with write access adds on a branch.
- [ ] The `main` ruleset's required check `check` (above) can be chosen once CI has run on main once.

- [ ] Tags are signed, so anyone can see who made a release as well as what it is:
      `git tag -s v1.0.0 -m "Tiny Little Office v1.0.0" && git push origin v1.0.0`. `-s` signs with a GPG key,
      or with an SSH key under `git config gpg.format ssh` and `user.signingkey`; add the same key to the
      GitHub account as a **signing key**, so the tag shows as Verified. Anyone checks one with `git tag -v`.
- [ ] A tag ruleset (Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New tag ruleset): name `releases`, enforcement **Active**,
      target the pattern `v*`; **Restrict creations**, **Restrict updates**, **Restrict deletions**, **Block force
      pushes**; bypass list: the **Maintain** role (and the organization's admins), so only maintainers can create
      a tag `v*`, and so only they can deploy. The workflows assume this ruleset: a tag `v*` that exists is a
      maintainer's decision to ship.
- [ ] Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions: leave **Read repository contents** as the default;
      the deploy workflow asks for its own per job: the deploy `contents: read` and `id-token: write` (npm's
      provenance), the release `contents: write`, `id-token: write` and `attestations: write`.

A release is checked with `gh attestation verify tinylittleoffice-v1.0.0.tar.gz -R aboard-io/tinylittleoffice`
(built by that workflow, from that commit), and the live site against it with
`npm run verify-deploy -- https://tinylittleoffice.com/ v1.0.0`.
