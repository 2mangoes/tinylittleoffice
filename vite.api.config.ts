/**
 * The API for programs and agents (src/api.ts) as an ES module the site serves at /api.js: a build of its own,
 * after the site's (npm run build), so it shares nothing with the pages and changes nothing they load. Two files:
 * /api.js, everything an import of it runs before its first call (the kernel, the codec, the routes), and one
 * file under /api/, its lazy part (the apps' definitions, templates and views for apps(), templates() and the
 * exports, the lint and the examples), fetched the first time one of those is asked for.
 *
 * Never an editor, never the chrome: the API leaves out, as an external import it never makes, what only a page
 * uses (PAGE_ONLY): a definition reaches its editor and its commands by a lazy import (`editor()`, `commands()`), which
 * a program never calls. With the editors out, no stylesheet is made: theirs are the only ones the API could reach.
