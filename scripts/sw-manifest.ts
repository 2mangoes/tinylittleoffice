/**
 * The service worker's list (src/sw.ts, built to dist/sw.js): the files it keeps when it is installed, and its
 * cache's name, written into dist/sw.js by the build (vite.config.ts, after the pages are written). The name is a hash
 * of the listed files' bytes, so a deploy that changes any of them is a new sw.js, which the browser installs on the
 * next online visit and which then deletes the old cache. The list:
 *
 *   - the pages: the home page and each app's ("", "write/", …), as the worker asks for them by address;
 *   - the app file and the stylesheet (dist/assets/app-<hash>.js and .css), and the theme script the pages run first
 *     (dist/assets/theme-<hash>.js);
 *   - the manifest and the icons it and the pages name;
 *   - the Latin faces: Plex Sans and Serif, regular and semibold, and Plex Mono.
 *
 * Not the templates, the other languages or the other faces: the worker keeps each the first time a page asks for
 * it. Nothing in the list depends on the clock or the machine, so two builds are the same bytes (scripts/reproducible.ts).
